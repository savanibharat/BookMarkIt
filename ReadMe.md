BookMarkIt :: 

In this era of internet, there are so many resources available on the internet that it has become a problem of how to keep track of all the resources. People use traditional system of bookmarks wherein they can save the resources and links and can get them as per their needs. This does help in a certain way but as your bookmark lists pile up it becomes hard to maintain. A new system that can better handle our bookmarks is in demand. A system that can make our lives easy and manage our bookmarks in a graphical way and we can have it anytime, anywhere instantly.
